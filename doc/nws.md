# nws(1) - normalize whitespace

## SYNOPSIS

Normalizes whitespace in one of several modes.

    nws [-m <mode>] [<text>...]

`<mode>` values (treatment of newlines in multi-line input):

    mp   (default) multi-paragraph: fold multiple blank lines into one
    fp   flattened multi-paragraph: normalize each paragraph to single line
    sp   single-paragraph: remove all blank lines.
    sl   single-line: normalize to single output line

Alternatively, specify mode values directly as options; e.g., `--sp` in lieu  
of `-m sp`

Standard options: `--help`, `--man`, `--version`, `--home`

## DESCRIPTION

`nws` (*n*ormalize *w*hite*s*pace) performs whitespace normalization,  
offering several modes.

Input is provided via one or more operands or, in their absence, via stdin.  
To disambiguate operands from options, precede operands with `--` as a  
separate argument.

Specifying a mode with option `-m` applies only to *multi-line* input;  
all modes behave identically with respect to normalizing a given single  
line, namely:  
Any run of any mix of spaces and tabs is replaced with a single space  
each, except leading and trailing runs, which are discarded.

## OPTIONS

  * `-m <mode>` or `--mode <mode>`  
    where `<mode>` is one of:

    * `mp`, `multi-para` (default)  
      Runs of blank (all-whitespace or empty) lines are replaced with 1 empty  
      line each, resulting in paragraph-internal newlines getting preserved,  
      with blank lines at the beginning, between paragraphs, and at the end  
      getting normalized to a single empty line each.  

    * `fp`, `flat-para`  
      Like mode `mp`, except that paragraph-internal newlines are replaced  
      with a single space each, resulting in each paragraph becoming a  
      single line, with 1 empty line between paragraphs.  

    * `sp`, `single-para`  
      Runs of blank (all-whitespace or empty) lines are discarded, resulting  
      in a single paragraph of non-blank lines.

    * `sl`, `single-line`  
      Normalization includes newlines too, so that any run of any mix of  
      spaces, tabs, and newlines is replaced with a single space each,  
      resulting in a single, long output line.

You may specify mode values as options directly; e.g., `--fp` or `--flat-para`  
in lieu of  `-m fp` or `--mode fp` or `--mode flat-para`.

## STANDARD OPTIONS

All standard options provide information only.

 * `-h, --help`  
   Prints the contents of the synopsis chapter to stdout for quick reference.

 * `--man`  
   Displays this manual page, which is a helpful alternative to using `man`,  
   if the manual page isn't installed.

 * `--version`  
   Prints version information.
  
 * `--home`  
   Opens this utility's home page in the system's default web browser.

## EXAMPLES
    
The examples use ANSI C-quoted input strings (`$'...'`) for brevity, which  
are supported in Bash, Ksh, and Zsh.  
Empty output lines are represented by `~`.

    # Single-line input - no mode needed.
    $ nws $'  one \t\t two  three   '
    one two three

    # Default: multi-paragraph mode (`-m mp` or `--mode multi-para`)
    $ nws <<<$'\n\n  one\n two \n\n\n  three\n\n'
    ~
    one
    two
    ~
    three
    ~

    # Single-paragraph mode; `-m sp` is the short equivalent of
    # `--mode single-para`.
    $ nws -m sp <<<$'\n\n  one\n two \n\n\n  three\n\n'
    one
    two
    three

    # Flattened-paragraph mode; note use of shorcut option `--fp` for `-m fp`.
    nws --fp <<<$'\n\n  one\n two \n\n\n  three\n\n'
    ~
    one two
    ~
    three
    ~

    # Single-line mode
    $ nws --sl <<<$'  one two\n  three '
    one two three
